    Web Server: The ESP32 hosts a web server that serves the video stream and the HTML interface.
    Stream Video: The camera feed is streamed to the web page using a video element.
    Record Button: A button to initiate video recording (this is a placeholder; you will need to implement the actual recording logic based on your requirements).
    Sci-Fi Interface: The GUI has a sci-fi look with a dark background and cyan accents.





    Set Up Hardware: Connect the ESP32 and camera module.
    Upload Code: Use an IDE compatible with MicroPython to upload the code to the ESP32.
    Connect to Wi-Fi: Make sure to replace 'your_SSID' and 'your_password' with your actual Wi-Fi credentials.
    Access the GUI: Open a web browser and navigate to http://<ESP32_IP>/ to access the interface. Replace <ESP32_IP> with the actual IP address of your ESP32.
    Testing: Test the streaming and recording functionality.
